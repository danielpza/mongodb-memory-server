## Breaking Changes

### Minimal NodeJS version is now `16`

With 10.0.0 the minimal nodejs required is `16.20.1`.

### Mongodb Driver Version upgraded to 6.x

The used MongoDB Driver version is now `6.7.0`.

### Default binary version is now 7.x

The default binary version has been upgraded from `6.0.x` to `7.0.x`. For more specifics see [mongodb-server-versions](../mongodb-server-versions.md).

:::note
In mongodb `7.0.0` storage engine `ephemeralForTest` has been removed, mongodb-memory-server will automatically translate any occurrence to `wiredTiger` with a warning.

It is recommended to run the tests against a tmpfs or equivalent (default `/tmp` on linux / macos).

## Non-Breaking changes / Additions

### Compiler target is now `es2021`

The tsconfig `target` option has been updated to `es2021`, which will result in less polyfills.
This should be a non-breaking change.

### Getport now uses `net0listen` by default

This means a port is now generated by the engine (like nodejs) itself, previously known as `EXP_NET0LISTEN`.
This should reduce amount of `Max port tries exceeded` errors.
