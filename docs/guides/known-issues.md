## ArchLinux on Docker

It is known that ArchLinux on Docker does not have an `/etc/os-release` or `/etc/lsb-release`, so detection will not work.

Workaround:

- Create one of these files (either manually, or install `lsb-release`)
- Use a SystemBinary with [`SYSTEM_BINARY`](../api/config-options.md#system_binary)
- Use an pre-set Archive Name to be used with [`ARCHIVE_NAME`](../api/config-options.md#archive_name)

## No Build available for Alpine Linux

It is known that [AlpineLinux](./supported-systems.md#alpine) does not have an official build (and no build like the ubuntu build works).

Workaround:

- Use a SystemBinary with [`SYSTEM_BINARY`](../api/config-options.md#system_binary)
- Do not use AlpineLinux

## libcurl on older or custom Docker images

When running older docker images or a custom image not based on any `node` image, then `libcurl4` will likely need to be manually installed, otherwise MongoDB binary will not start since version `5.0.0` on most distributions.

> libcurl4 is not available on your system. Mongod requires it and cannot be started without it.

This can be resolved by installing it in your image:

```sh
apt-get install libcurl4
```
